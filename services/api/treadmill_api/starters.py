"""Canonical starter workflows + roles for a fresh Treadmill install.

Per ADR-0015 (multi-step workflows + role reuse), Treadmill ships twelve
roles and eleven workflows. Six of the workflows are single-step
(``wf-author``, ``wf-review``, ``wf-validate``, ``wf-doc-amend``,
``wf-architecture-resolve``, ``wf-audit-rule-corpus``) and five are
two-step analyzer-then-action shapes (``wf-plan``, ``wf-feedback``,
``wf-ci-fix``, ``wf-conflict``, ``wf-crystallize-learning``).
The shared terminals are ``role-code-author`` (wf-author, wf-feedback,
wf-ci-fix, wf-conflict) and ``role-documentarian`` (wf-doc-amend).

This module exposes:

  * ``STARTERS`` — the nine canonical workflows + their underlying
    roles, fully declared as plain dicts. ``test_starters.py``
    enforces the content invariants per ADR-0015 §"``starters.py``
    rewrite".

  * ``seed(api_client, *, reset_prompts_from_code=False)`` — POSTs each
    role + workflow + version to the existing CRUD endpoints, swallowing
    409s so re-runs are idempotent. Returns a ``SeedResult`` with the
    count of newly created workflows + the list of role ids whose
    prompts were reset (only non-empty when ``reset_prompts_from_code``
    is True; per ADR-0028 the DB is authoritative for prompts after
    bootstrap, so the explicit-opt-in flag is the recovery path for
    "the DB drifted and I want the code-side back").

The planner is the only role on the expensive opus tier per ADR-0015
§"Trade-offs". All other roles (including the analyzers) run on the
cheap haiku tier — analyzer cost is the rationale for splitting
analyzer from action in the first place.

# Each ``system_prompt`` below is the full role-specific prompt authored

#   * its output contract (the uniform ``StepOutput`` envelope from
#     ADR-0012 — ``summary`` / ``decision`` / ``commit_sha`` / ``artifacts``
#     / ``payload``) with the explicit decision value-set,
#   * the action it performs (which tools / commands to run).
#
# Analyzer roles produce a ``task_directive`` in ``payload.task_directive``
# (the analyzer→action contract per ADR-0015 §"``task_directive``"). The
# shared terminal ``role-code-author`` consumes either a task spec
# (single-step ``wf-author``) or a ``task_directive`` from
