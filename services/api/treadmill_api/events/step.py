"""Workflow-run-step lifecycle events.

Steps go through ``ready → started → (completed | failed | cancelled)``;
the consumer that reads these events writes ``workflow_run_steps.status``
per ADR-0011's single-writer projection pattern.

``StepCompleted.output`` carries the uniform ``StepOutput`` envelope
(ADR-0012). The envelope is universal across every role and every
workflow; per-workflow extras live in ``StepOutput.payload`` by
documented convention (ADR-0012 §"Convention map for wf-author's
payload" + ADR-0015 §"Per-workflow shape matrix"). The Week-2-closure
``AuthorStepOutput`` Pydantic class is intentionally absent — its
fields demote into the envelope (``commit_sha`` at top-level, ``branch``
and ``pr_url`` as ``Artifact``s, ``pr_number`` in ``payload``).
