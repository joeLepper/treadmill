"""``review`` disposition — post a PR review via ``gh pr review``.

Per ADR-0022, the review-kind role's prompt instructs Claude to end
its output with ``VERDICT: approve | request_changes | comment``. The
handler greps for the last matching line; if none is found, the
verdict defaults to ``comment`` (the safe default — never accidentally
approves a PR Treadmill can't actually evaluate).

Empty diff is a SUCCESS for review-kind. The reviewer was asked to
look at code, not to modify it. The PR-side side effect (the posted
review) is the role's actual output.

Required context: ``pr_number`` must be present on the step context.
A review-kind step against a task that hasn't opened a PR yet is a
configuration error worth catching loudly (``MissingContextError``).

# that to ``blocked-on-review``, the runner re-authored, and the loop

# decorations the model produces under emphasis instructions: leading
# list / blockquote markers, surrounding ``*`` / ``_`` / backtick
# wrapping, and trailing punctuation. The durable fix is a structured
# JSON envelope (ADR-0027); this widening is the tourniquet that lets
